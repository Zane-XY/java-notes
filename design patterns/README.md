Design Patterns
======

- the first year when I graduated from college, *Design Pattern* seemed like something magical that can distinguish between junior and senior programmers. When I was reading *Head First Design Patterns*, I was thinking, "damn, it's so smart". Today, when I look at design patterns again, I'm like "huh? you call this design pattern? it's the default way to write code"
- the never-technological-evolving corporate-developers still need it to get a job.
- it's useful when a corporate-developer becomes the interviewer, and you still want the job.
- it's still useful for me to criticise someone who don't know the default way to write code.
