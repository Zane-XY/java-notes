Abstract Factory
======
this pattern is so simple that almost sounds ridiculous to call this as a design pattern.
If you know how Polymorphism works in OO languages, it's just means a method takes a polymorphic type.

I found [this explaination](http://java.dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-abstract-factory) is close to the original definition.

```java
public void buildWindow(AbstractWidgetFactory widgetFactory)
```

@[a not tested example](AbstractFactory.java)
